# randomlisttools

A collection of, well, *random list tools*. Some are useful, some were personal challenges, others were just fun
to create.

If you *randomly* found your way here, congrats, I think. Review the code, feel free to take anything you find useful,
let me know what you like, and if you feel the need share what you think could be improved and why.
